PALO ALTO - The most recent death on November 4th of Cameron Lee, a junior from Gunn High School has reignited discussion about suicide in the Palo Alto community. Lee’s death comes less than three weeks after Quinn Gens’ tragedy on October 15th. Both boys took their lives on the Caltrain tracks this fall.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention defines suicide to be a death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with any intent to die as a result of the behavior. In other words, it’s the act of intentionally taking one’s own life.

These tragic stories grappled the Palo Alto community forcing school administrators, parents, community members and Caltrain to come up with a way to prevent more suicides from happening.

Caltrain is a form of transportation that connects people living in the Bay Area from the San Francisco station near AT&T Park to Gilroy Station. The train stops at 32 different stops seven days a week. 

Commuters use the Caltrain to travel to and from work. Others may take the train to San Francisco to watch a ball game with their friends and families. But in places like Palo Alto and Menlo Park, some people use the tracks as a way to end their lives.  

Lee and Gens are two out of eight people who died on the Caltrain’s right of way this year. Caltrain’s public information officer Christine Dunn says since 1992, there have been an average of 12 accidents per year.

But in 2009, there were a total of 19 deaths on the tracks with 15 of these deaths being categorized as suicides.

From 2009 to present day, there have been a total of 79 deaths on the train tracks. Of those 79 fatalities, 64 of the incidents were labeled to be suicides. That’s excluding the 7 deaths from this year that are still pending.

Even though there have been more deaths each year that have been categorized as suicides, Christine Dunn says “it would be erroneous to assume that this data indicates any trends.”

But suicides aren’t only happening in the Bay Area. It’s an issue that affects the whole state.

California, a state that currently has more than 38 million residents is ranked number 1 in total number of deaths by suicide. However, when all the states are ranked by the rate at which these deaths occur, California shifts towards the bottom half of the list with Alaska, Wyoming and Montana taking over the top three spots.

The mathematical equation that organizations use to compute the rate is the number of suicides by group divided by the population of each state multiplied by 100,000.

Even though states like Wyoming, Montana and Alaska don’t have nearly as many people as California, the rates for each of these states in 2012 were 29.7, 23.3 and 23.0, respectively. California’s number that year was 10.2.

Initially, the numbers may not seem like a big deal because they don’t go any higher than 30 percent. However, if we were to look at it by breaking down the total number of deaths in each individual state, you may change your mind.

In 2009, California was ranked 42 and Montana was ranked 1when compared to other states by the rate of suicides. However, that same year, California had a total of 3,823 deaths and Montana only had 219.

It’s the same pattern for the next three years. California consistently is considered to be the leading state in terms of total deaths but ranks 42 or 44 depending on the year when it’s compared to other states on its suicide rate.

As you can see from the charts that the American Association of Sociology and the CDC produced, there are more and more suicides each year that take place in this country.

On a national level, suicide seems to be a topic that only gets covered once an incident occurs and for several more days until something bigger and more grandiose takes over. You mourn the loss of someone who you may have never met before, but forget about them a few days later when something more important piques your interest. 

Prominent newspaper publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post and television stations like CNN and NBC all report on this issue. However, what readers may not be aware of, are the exact numbers that show audience members why this is an ongoing battle in the United States.


Thomas Joiner, a professor at Florida State University, says suicide happens when four different types of feelings are mixed together: belongingness, capability, perceived burdensomeness and desire.

But as people read through article after article that discusses the scientific reasoning behind a mental illness like depression and how loved ones coped with the tragic loss, they don’t realize the big picture: suicides are on the rise and it’s not going away anytime soon.

In 2005, there were 32,637 suicides in the United States. If we were to break that down by sex, 25,907 men and 6,730 women took their own lives that year. But in just four years, that number rose to 36,909.

In a three-year span, the numbers continued to increase until they hit an all time high of more than 40,000 suicides in 2012.  The graph, which breaks down each of the numbers by year, shows time and time again that men are three times more likely to commit suicide than women are, in our country.

But the total number of fatalities excludes the number of attempted suicides that take place in the United States each year. 

For example, in 2009 there were a total of 36,909 suicides that coroners from each state recorded. The American Association of Suicidology, which verifies its findings with what the CDC has on record, states there are 25 attempted suicides for each death that occurs.

So that means in 2009 there were 922,725 attempted suicides. However, one idea that we have to keep in mind is that this number only includes the attempted suicides it has on record. The total number could be higher since they can’t take into account the incidents that weren’t recorded when conducting this study.

From sifting through all this data and compiling these charts into something that’s easily readable and understood, there’s one thing that’s clear. More and more people in the United States are taking their own lives as a means to an end, and from the data that has been presented to you in this story, it doesn’t seem like the numbers will be going down anytime soon.
