At first, I tried to create this map on the fusion table but found that TileMill was much easier to use and much more efficient in getting this point across. I had problems initially because I wasn't exporting the spreadsheet correctly, but once I got it right TileMill made the map very easy to read. After changing the count and color for various Victim ID's, I could clearly see which areas had higher homocides and which areas had smaller numbers. I feel that one of the biggest deficencies from this map is how messy it is. Even though you have different size circles for different ranges, it's still very messy because they all look like they're on top of each other.
