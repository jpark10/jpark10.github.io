At first, I tried to create this map on the fusion table but found that TileMill was much easier to use and much more efficient in getting this point across. I had problems initially because I wasn't exporting the spreadsheet correctly, but once I got it right TileMill made the map very easy to read. After changing the count and color for various Victim ID's, I could clearly see which areas had higher homocides and which areas had smaller numbers.
