I decided to contributors to Barack Obama from people who lived in Buena Vista, CO. At first I wanted to do people form Boulder, but then saw how some idiotic people spelled Boulder with 2 r's and realized I couldn't deal with the stupidity. However, with Buena Vista, I cleaend up several occupations like some people were considered retired while there were two people considered to be retired federal employees. Then there were people who spelled an organization that had a period at the end of a word and those who didn't so I combined those as one to make it more collective.
