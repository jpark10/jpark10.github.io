- So I was looking around the NY Times website and came across this interactive graph and I honestly couldn't believe it!! IT WAS SO COOL. So what this shows, if you couldn't tell already, is which players come from what European soccer teams and what country they originally came from. I think this is an example of a good visualiation because it's very easy to navigate, though initially, it may seem to be difficult. Once you click on a certain team, it whites out all the other teams and only highlights in green the players and locations that you're specifically looking for.

- So after looking through several other compelling, intersting and just beautifully created graphs from the New York Times, I came across this little graph from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. I think the legend does a good job at clarifying what color correlates to what topic, but I think the type of graph it chose to create was a mistake. Instead of using this particular graph, I think if the designer used either a bar graph or a pie chart it would've been much easier to read and figure out what percentage point goes with what specific year. Also for people who don't really know too much about what a deficit is and what it means for the economy, because there isn't an explanation on the graph, they wouldn't know what it means for there it to be a "deficit without these factors" and "projected deficit under current policies."
