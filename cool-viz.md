- So I was looking around the NY Times website and came across this interactive graph and I honestly couldn't believe it!! IT WAS SO COOL. So what this shows, if you couldn't tell already, is which players come from what European soccer teams and what country they originally came from. I think this is an example of a good visualiation because it's very easy to navigate, though initially, it may seem to be difficult. Once you click on a certain team, it whites out all the other teams and only highlights in green the players and locations that you're specifically looking for.

- So after looking through several other compelling, intersting and just beautifully created graphs from the New York Times, I came across this little graph from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. I think the legend does a good job at clarifying what color correlates to what topic, but I think the type of graph it chose to create was a mistake. Instead of using this particular graph, I think if the designer used either a bar graph or a pie chart it would've been much easier to read and figure out what percentage point goes with what specific year. Also for people who don't really know too much about what a deficit is and what it means for the economy, because there isn't an explanation on the graph, they wouldn't know what it means for there it to be a "deficit without these factors" and "projected deficit under current policies."

Story:

PALO ALTO – The recent tragedy involving a 16 year-old Gunn High School student on November 11 has re-sparked talks between school administrators and parents on teen suicides. Cameron Lee took his own life last week, which comes only one month after a 2014 Gunn High School alumnus also committed suicide mid October.

But this isn’t the first time Gunn, one of the two public high schools that’s part of the Palo Alto Unified School District, has faced these incidents. In 2009-2010, there were six teen suicides in Palo Alto and five of these students were either current Gunn High School students or alumni that had recently graduated.

Teen suicide, which may seem like a bigger problem in Palo Alto than other places in the Bay Area, is proven to be an issue in all parts of the United States. The total number of these incidents has increased by four percent since 2012. After looking at the data from several different organizations, it's clear that most people take their lives by using some sort of firearm, whether it may be with a gun or a knife. 



FUTURE PLANS:

By Friday I should have the total number of teen suicides in Palo Alto alone within the last 7 years since the biggest number comes from 2009-2010 and even the total number of these incidents in neighboring places like Cupertino. I would also hopefully have the breakdown of what percentage of people used a certain method to committ these acts. During break, I'm going to continue my search on this, but on a national level and contact the necessary offices I would need to speak with in order to get these data charts.
