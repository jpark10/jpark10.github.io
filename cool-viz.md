So I was looking around the NY Times website and came across this interactive graph and I honestly couldn't believe it!! IT WAS SO COOL. So what this shows, if you couldn't tell already, is which players came from what European teams and what country they originally came from. I think this is an example of a good visualiation because it's very easy to navigate, though it may be difficult at the first glance. Once you click on a certain team, it whites out all the other teams and only highlights in green what you're specifically looking for.
