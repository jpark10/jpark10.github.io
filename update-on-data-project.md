A lot of people couldn't talk last week, so I had an interview with the superintendent of the Palo Alto school district this afternoon and have one with a member of the school board on Wednesday and a Caltrain spokesperson on Thursday. I didn't get a lot of numbers for this data project from the superintendent but I'll be able to get better information from the other two people I speak with. (Hopefully) But I've been looking at other websites that have reported on suicides in the past and have been trying to find the total number of incidents that have happened in the last several years. I'm still trying to figure out the specific direction I want to go in, but I think like you mentioned in your e-mail, I'm going to try and find the most information about suicides of high school students, not only in the Bay Area but also in the United States as a whole. I know from the information I have already looked at that there has been an increase in suicide rates by 4% from 2009 to 2014 but I'm still in the midst of finding more information on this. I got the contact information of a mom of the son who was part of the first cluster of suicides in Palo Alto that has been doin research since her son's death on suicides, so she may be helpful as well.
